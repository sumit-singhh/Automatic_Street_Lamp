# Automatic_Street_Lamp

This is a prototype of an automatic street lamp. It works on the principle of photoresistor.
Automtatic street lamp works in a way that when there is sunlight it will remain turned off and as the sun sets lamp will automatically turn on. 
This will reduce the human effort to turn on/off the switch when required
